==========================

YunoHost is built and maintained by the YunoHost project community.

Initial YunoHost core was built by Kload & beudbeud, for YunoHost v2.

Most of code was written by Kload and jerome, with help of numerous contributors.

Translation is made by a bunch of lovely people all over the world.

We would like to thank anyone who ever helped the YunoHost project <3
